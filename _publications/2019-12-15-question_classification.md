In this paper, we have described our deep learning based system for fine-grained insincere questions classification, which is the CIQ track in FIRE 2019. Our pipeline uses ensembles of bidirectional LSTMGRU model with different word embedding techniques namely Glove, FastText, and Paragram. We have also used the checkpoint ensemble method to enhance performance alongside a combination of two different embeddings per-ensemble. Our pipeline has secured the first position in this track with an F1 score of 67.32%.
