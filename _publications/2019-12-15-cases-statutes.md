In this paper, we have described the systems that we submitted as team JU SRM for FIRE 2019 track on Artificial Intelligence for
Legal Assistance (AILA 2019). The two tasks in this track were 1) identifying relevant prior cases and 2) identifying relevant statutes. For both of these tasks, we took an unsupervised approach using pre-trained wordembeddings for encoding texts and calculating relevance using cosinesimilarity between the query and target documents.
